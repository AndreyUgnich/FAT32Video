# FAT32Video

The FAT32 file system is still widely used, although it is limited by a maximum file size of (almost) 4 GiB, which is especially noticeable when it comes to video playback.

The FAT32Video script cuts video files larger than 4 GiB into pieces so that they can be recorded and played on FAT32 devices without losing the quality of the original video.
